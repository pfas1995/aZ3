+ aZ3.jar : the All-SMT front-end for z3 4.4
+ sharpSMT : stand-alone #SMT wrapper for MathSAT, compiled from MathSAT 5.2.11
+ QF_LIA : benchmarks created by Symbolic PathFinder, except for ex.smt2 is created manually.
+ QF_AUFBV : benchmarks created by CBMC 5.1

============

To use aZ3:

+ We provide libz3.so and libz3java.so that have been compiled in a 64-bit Fedora machine.
Please copy to your folder, and point LD_LIBRARY_PATH to these files.

If your machine is different, you need to compile these libraries from the z3 source:
http://z3.codeplex.com/

+ Use the option java -jar aZ3.jar --help for more info

java -jar aZ3.jar QF_LIA/ex.smt2
-> return the number of models

java -jar aZ3.jar QF_LIA/ex.smt2 --bc
-> return the number of models. The blocking clauses method is used. Default is depth-first search All-SMT.

java -jar aZ3.jar QF_LIA/ex.smt2 --model
-> return the number of models and prints all models

java -jar aZ3.jar QF_LIA/ex.smt2 --model --rv
-> return the number of models and prints all models, values of relevant variables are included in the models.

The relevant variables in QF_LIA have been commented out to use with MathSAT.
Remove these comments to include values of relevant variables in the models.

============

To use sharpSMT : 

./sharpSMT QF_LIA/ex.smt2

sharpSMT is compiled with MathSAT 5.2.11 in a 64-bit Fedora machine.
If it doesn't work, it can be re-compiled using the source sharpSMT.c
